@client_register @event
Feature: Customer registration event processing
  In order to integrate with Synerise
  As a system administrator
  I want customer registration events to be processed based on configuration

  Background:
    Given there is a workspace with test api key and request logging enabled
    And the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
    And this workspace is assigned to this channel

  @default @no-queue
  Scenario: Registering a new account without uuid cookie
    Given on this channel account verification is required
    And the channel is configured with settings:
        | events    | client.register   |
    And api response will be mocked with:
        | accepted  |
    When I want to register a new account
    And I specify the first name as "Saul"
    And I specify the last name as "Goodman"
    And I specify the email as "goodman@example.com"
    And I specify the password as "heisenberg"
    And I confirm this password
    And I register this account
    Then I should be notified that new account has been successfully created
    And I should be on registration thank you page
    And logs should show 1 request to "/v4/events/registered" with data:
        | body          | "email":"goodman@example.com" |
        | status_code   | 202                           |
